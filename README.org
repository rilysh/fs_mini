** fs_mini
A small, header-only C++ file to work with filesystem I/O.

** Example
See the =test= folder.

** Why?
Mostly to satisfy my needs. Currently, C++11 don't have
a "proper" set of APIs to work with filesystem I/O,
and only C++17 introduced a new header called "filesystem".
While I can use this STL header, it doesn't offer backward
compatibility with C++11 (which I need to work on).

There's an excellent implementation of STL "filesystem"
at [[https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem][gulrak's]] GitHub, but for my purpose, it's _too large_.
I don't need every single filesystem APIs, but only a few,
so I made this.

Please don't use this in production!
